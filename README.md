## Team Roles

A project is a collaborative effort requiring various specialized roles:

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions.
- **Frontend Developer**: Builds the user interface and ensures a seamless user experience.
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Manages the setup, tuning, and maintenance of the project's databases.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Implements CI/CD pipelines, manages deployments, and ensures infrastructure reliability.
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates team efforts, timelines, and communication across the project.

Each role ensures that the application is robust, scalable, and maintainable throughout the development lifecycle.


## Technology Stack

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project utilizes a range of technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. Below is a list of the core technologies and their purpose in the project:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build and organize the core backend functionalities and API logic.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful toolkit built on Django for building RESTful APIs, handling serialization, authentication, and permissions.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database used to store and manage structured application data such as users, properties, and bookings.
- **GraphQL**: A flexible query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and developer experience.
- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue used to manage background tasks like sending notifications or processing long-running jobs (e.g., payments).
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used to support caching and as a message broker for Celery tasks.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing, building, and deploying of code changes to reduce manual effort and improve deployment speed.


## Database Design

The database schema for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments efficiently. Below are the key entities and their important fields, along with their relationships:

### 🧑 Users
- `id`: Unique identifier for the user.
- `name`: Full name of the user.
- `email`: Email address (used for login).
- `password`: Hashed password for authentication.
- `user_type`: Identifies whether the user is a host or a guest.

### 🏠 Properties
- `id`: Unique identifier for the property.
- `owner_id`: Foreign key linking to the User who owns the property.
- `title`: Name or short description of the property.
- `location`: City or region where the property is located.
- `price_per_night`: Rental cost per night.

### 📅 Bookings
- `id`: Unique identifier for the booking.
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the User who made the booking.
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the booked Property.
- `start_date`: Start date of the booking.
- `end_date`: End date of the booking.

### 💳 Payments
- `id`: Unique identifier for the payment.
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the related Booking.
- `amount`: Total payment amount.
- `payment_status`: Status of the payment (e.g., pending, completed).
- `payment_date`: Date the payment was processed.

### 📝 Reviews
- `id`: Unique identifier for the review.
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the User who wrote the review.
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the reviewed Property.
- `rating`: Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5 stars).
- `comment`: Textual feedback from the user.

### 🔗 Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- Each **Booking** is linked to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is associated with a **Booking**.
- A **Review** is made by a **User** and linked to a **Property**.


## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes several core features that replicate key functionalities of the real Airbnb platform. Each feature is designed to ensure a smooth experience for both hosts and guests.

### 👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure authentication and user-specific access to bookings, properties, and reviews.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, update details, and remove listings. It forms the core of the platform by enabling accommodation options for users to browse and book.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables guests to book properties for specific dates and manage their reservations. It ensures proper availability tracking and prevents double bookings.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Handles all financial transactions between guests and hosts. Ensures secure and reliable payments for bookings and provides a record of completed transactions.

### 📝 Review System
Allows guests to leave feedback and ratings for properties they've stayed in. Helps maintain trust and transparency within the platform by showcasing user experiences.

### ⚙️ Data Optimization
Implements indexing and caching to enhance performance. It ensures that data retrieval operations remain fast and efficient as the user base and listings grow.


## API Security

Securing the backend APIs of the Airbnb Clone project is critical to protecting user data, ensuring safe financial transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the system. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### 🔐 Authentication
User authentication will be enforced using secure methods such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources and perform authorized actions on the platform.

### 🛡️ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to manage permissions for different types of users (e.g., guest, host, admin). This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations, such as editing properties or viewing another user’s bookings.

### 📊 Rate Limiting
API rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This ensures that no single user or client can overwhelm the system with excessive requests.

### 🔒 Data Encryption
All sensitive data, including passwords and payment details, will be encrypted in transit using HTTPS and in storage using hashing or encryption techniques. This protects user data from interception and leakage.

### 🧪 Input Validation & Sanitization
All API inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This helps maintain the integrity and security of the backend.

By implementing these security measures, the platform ensures user trust, protects critical data, and maintains a secure environment for all interactions.
